# Big Data

## Key Concepts

**What is Big Data?**

**Big Data** is a collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes
difficult to process using traditional database management systems and
data processing applications.

_Definition from Gartner,_

**Big data** is high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety information
assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing
that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation.

**Important Characteristics of Big Data (3V's)**
  * Volume: _scale of the data_
  * Velocity: _speed at which the data is generated_
  * Variety: _diversity of the data_

_Variety_ can be further divided into 3 major categories.
  * Structured data: _organized text files, relational DB, spreadsheets_
  * Unstructured data: _images, videos_
  * Semi-structured data: _XML, JSON, Web log files_

_Veracity_ (_certainty of the data_) & _value_ (_extracting knowledge_) are other characteristics of Big data.

**Common Challenges in Big Data**
  * Capturing
  * Storing
  * Searching
  * Sharing
  * Analyzing
  * Visualizing

**Big Data sources** (some examples not an extensive list)
  * User generated (mobile, interactions on social media)
  * Device generated (IoT, surveillance devices)
