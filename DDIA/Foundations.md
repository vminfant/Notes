# Designing Data-intensive applications

## Foundations

An application is **data intensive** if data is its primary challenge - the quantity of data, the complexity of data or the speed at which it is changing.

### Key Concepts

* Reliability
* Scalability
* Maintainability

**Reliability** - System should continue to work correctly even when things go wrong.
